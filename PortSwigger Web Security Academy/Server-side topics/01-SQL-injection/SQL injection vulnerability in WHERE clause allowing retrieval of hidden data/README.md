## Steps
Once if we visit website, select any category. After this, you will see item of this category.

Look at URL <https://foo.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Food+%26+Drink>

We can see query string **?category=Food+%26+Drink** let's try add **'+OR+1=1--** in the end. 

- **+** - mean "whitespace"
- **1=1** is always ***True*** and mean "everything"
- **--** comment 

we say to website: show me items in **category** - **Food & Drink** or **True**.

In SQL it be:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Food & Drink' OR 1=1--SOME_QUERY
```
After that you receive all items from database table, not only 'Food & Drink'. 

**Congratulations, you solved the lab!**
